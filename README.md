# Code-Quiz

The purpose of this project was to create a code quiz that would dynamically change when the user would click buttons.
Process of Creating the Code Quiz:
1. Set up HTML Boiler Plate that would be dynamically changed with JS.
2. In JS, created a score variable to store the score of the player, and also a localstorage item to store the score of the player.
3. Create a function called GenerateQuestion to generate the buttons through a for loop, and then append them to the page.
4. Within the function, create conditionals for each button pressed on the page, and make sure that it would lead to the next question in case anything went wrong. 
5. Create a timer that would reduce as the quiz went  on, or if the user answered a question wrong. 
The Code overall was not complete, but the quiz works at about 80% capacity and stores a score in the local storage. There were no bells or whistles added, like the sound every time something came up wrong, 
or the small text saying that the answer was wrong.
